# Touching Grass

This is Touching Grass - the latest AAA title produced by Dark Pear Studios. In all seriousness, this is the first game I have ever produced. Despite not being super sophisticated art-wise, it was a great learning experience for me and got me started with Godot.

Touching grass is a very simple arcade style click-game, where you try to touch as much grass as possible without clicking on obstacles. The objective is to get the highest score possible.

## Play the Game Yourself

The game is playable in your browser on [Itch.io](https://thedarkpear.itch.io/touching-grass). On windows it should load pretty quickly but it seems like on MacOS chrome it takes a while to load.
