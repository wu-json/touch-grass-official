# Touching Grass

This is Touching Grass - the latest AAA title produced by Dark Pear Studios. In all seriousness, this is the first game I have ever produced. It is absolute trash but it was a great learning experience for me and got me started with Godot.

Touching grass is a very simple arcade style click-game, where you try to touch as much grass as possible without clicking on obstacles. The objective is to get the highest score possible.
